# EECS_LAB_TRAINING
The training summer vacation training of EECS lab

1. Combinational Logic Design(Code Calculator)- Resource sharing technique, high-level coding style in combinational @* block.
2. Sequential logic Design(Train Tour)- Algorithm to RTL architecture, self-derivation of algorithm then converting the algorithm into architecture.
3. Advanced Sequential Logic, pipelined design(CNN)- Creating pipelined architecture, resource sharing in IP level.
4. Testbench generation (Perfect Maze Solving)- Using algorithm to generate pattern, then convert the used algorithm to RTL design.
5. Hspice usage (Sim of 64-bit comparator) - Design a 64-bit comparator then connect and simulate the design using Hspice.
